An event-drivent osu! feeds.

## Why?
Because afaik, there are no open-source nomination feed for osu! We've seen Aiess and CPOL's nomination feed, but none of them are actually open sourced, therefore I'm here to bring the feed to the open source community!

## Contributing
Contribution is always welcome (obviously)! You can create a fork, do your changes and create a pull request to improve my shitty code or add one or two features!
